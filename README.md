## 5. Timeline

<!-- fill in the timeline with what happened, challenges and how you overcame them, little victories, link to sources if possible -->

## 6. What I learned from this exercise

<!--here you can write anything from a short summary on the subject of the exercise, a readable description of the new skills/knowledge you acquire, to an in depth clarification. As long as it helps you retain what you learned, or easily find the information when working on future projects-->

## 7. To Do

This to do list is for personal use, the full to do list is added at the start of the challenge and as we complete
objectives they will be moved up into the timeline section and ticked off using emotes such as :heavy_check_mark:

<!--For now, this list is usually provided by BeCode and thus quite static. When working on outside projects, this list will become more dynamic as the projects grow and evolve-->

### must-haves

### Nice to have

## 8. Installation Instructions for developers

<!--write clear instructions on how to get your project working on the user's local environment-->
